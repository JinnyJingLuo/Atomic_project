# Atomic_project

this is the class for tree class.

Two classes included, when using Tree class, make sure to contain the two class together:

In the tree class, three important functions can be used:
	insert(value)-insert a new element in this tree
	search(value)-search for a value if it exists in this tree
	sort()-sort the tree in descent order
	print_tree()-print all elements in the tree in descent order		
An example .py is included. All functions in Tree class are tested
